# **App Name**: Skill Rewards

## Core Features:

- User Registration: Allow users to create profiles to track their progress and earnings.
- Domain Selection: Enable users to choose from various domain-specific tests such as Java, Python, Cybersecurity, and more.
- Test Taking & Scoring: Provide a platform for users to take tests (MCQs, coding challenges) and automatically evaluate their answers to generate a score.
- Token Generation: Generate an appropriate number of tokens to award the user based on test score; for example, 80% score → 50 tokens. A tool decides the magnitude of the reward based on test score.
- Wallet Management: Store earned tokens in a user-specific wallet, displaying the current token balance.
- Leaderboard: Show a leaderboard with all the users and the scores

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust, knowledge, and professionalism.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#ECEFF1) to ensure a clean, focused learning environment.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF9800) to highlight rewards, transactions, and important CTAs, providing energy and excitement.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif, with a modern, neutral look suitable for headlines or body text.
- Use clean, modern icons related to skill domains (e.g., a gear for Java, a snake for Python) to visually represent different categories and actions.
- Implement a clear, intuitive layout with a navigation bar for easy access to different sections such as domains, tests, wallet, and profile.
- Use subtle animations for token earnings and successful test submissions to provide positive feedback and engagement.
